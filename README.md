## Air Quality Analysis Program

This program is designed to analyze air quality data using Python. It provides various analysis techniques and visualizations to gain insights into air quality indicators such as ozone and sulfur dioxide levels. The program utilizes popular libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and geopandas to load, process, analyze, and visualize the air quality data.

#### Features

    Outlier detection using box plots to identify extreme data values.
    Seasonal analysis to examine the average air quality indicators by season.
    Trend analysis to plot the ozone levels over time and observe temporal trends.
    Location comparison to compare the average ozone levels by borough.
    Before and after comparison to compare ozone levels before and after a specific event.
    Correlation analysis to explore the correlation between ozone and sulfur dioxide levels.
    Threshold analysis to determine the percentage of instances exceeding a specified threshold.

### Installation

    Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-quality-analysis.git
    Navigate to the project directory: cd air-quality-analysis
    Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage

    Place your air quality data file (e.g., Air_quality.csv) in the project directory.
    Update the data file path in the program code or specify the path during runtime.
    Run the program using a Python interpreter or execute the Jupyter Notebook.
